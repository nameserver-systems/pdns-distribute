The project [nameserver.systems](https://nameserver.systems) / pdns-distribute contains a set of go based microservices
for syncing multiple powerdns nameservers. The original goal was to build the perfect authoritative dns server
infrastructure. Most registrars and ISPs provide terrible DNS servers for their customers. Well known problems are too few servers,
restricted functionality (e.g. record types) and slow updates. This project provides a solution for those
problems and extended functionality with our service [nameserver.systems](https://nameserver.systems).

These microservices provide a fast, secure and easy way for syncing PowerDNS nameservers.

Microservices:
- pdns-zone-provider (provides secondary-syncer zonefiles as a signed zonestring)
- pdns-api-proxy (generates zone events from api interaction with powerdns primary)
- pdns-health-checker (watch the whole system sync state and triggers specific sync)
- pdns-secondary-syncer (cares about the sync of a local powerdns instance)

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://docs.nameserver.systems) and [Documentation Source](./docs)

## Architecture

- 1x primary (internal data management)
    - clients can using the primary through the powerdns api
    - contains zone information
- Nx secondary (public authoritative nameserver)
    - serves zone data
- Nx nats with jetstream (message broker)
    - complete communication between microservices will use handled by broker
    - used for discovering active healthy secondaries
    - healthchecks
        - after a defined interval without a ping a secondary will be marked as inactive
